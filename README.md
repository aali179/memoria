## Installation & Deployment

- Deployment will be done using docker (a requirement to run the application)
- Navigate to the /app directory within the application
- Run `docker-compose build`, this will generate an executable of the Go application
- Run  `docker-compose up -d postgres`, this will start the postgres db in the background
- Run `docker-compose up app migrate`
   - this will start the go application at http://localhost:5000, along with a migration if needed


## Migrations

- the postgres DB has been versioned and migration files have been created and run through `go-migrate`
- To run a db migration on its own `docker-compose up migrate`
   - this will read the migrations/ file in the folder and build a new version of the system (if changes have been present)
- As the migrations were not generated through GORM (typeORM used), a change to the model requires changes in both the appropriate files in the migrations/ folder and the structures in models/ folder
